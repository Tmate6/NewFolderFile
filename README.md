This app uses AppleScript to locate you currently selected folder, check if its empty, and convert it to a file. This works with any filename, or extension - except dotfiles. Apple doesn't like those.

## Installation
1. Download the app from the [releases](https://github.com/Tmate6/NewFolderFile/releases/latest) page.
2. Drag it into your Applications folder
3. When opening, a popup will tell you its from an unidentified developer. To bypass this, go to

     `Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Click "Open Anyway"`

     _(Make sure you have Allow applications set to "from App Store & Known Developers")_
5. The app may also ask for input monitoring and automation permissions. Click allow for both.

6. For ease of use, go to `Finder settings -> Advanced tab -> Disable "Show warning before changing an extension"`. This stops the annoying "Add file extension" popups.

You can record your own keyboard shortcuts, and change if you want the app to check the age of your folder before converting. You can also select if you want the app to open on startup.

## Acknowledgements
This app uses [Sindresorhus' KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts) for the keybinds.
